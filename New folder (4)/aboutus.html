        <h1><u> Our foundations. Your future.</u></h1>
        <h2> Rethinking education</h2>
        <p>
            That’s what Professor Keith Lumsden set out to do when he founded the Edinburgh Business School. No mean feat – but with our principles firmly anchored and an ambitious vision for the future to guide us, the foundations for what EBS would become were set.
        </p>

        <p>
            True to our principles of flexibility and accessibility, we offer the opportunity to study from anywhere in the world. We’re proud to say that, today, we offer online learning experiences that empower a diverse community of individuals from all around the world; from C-suite executives to family business owners, athletes to politicians.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our open, flexible way of working is all about the practical application of knowledge, encouraging everyone to raise the bar by doing more of what matters to them. We’re a graduate school of Heriot-Watt University, with whom we share our ethos of equality and accessibility. We share a global ethos as well, with a history of pioneering social milestones and educational innovations that help the world thrive through a more inclusive way of doing things.
        </p>

        <h2> On the ground</h2>
        <p>
            Our campuses are found in the UK, Dubai and Malaysia but thanks to a global network of learning partners, those who are unable to study on campus can benefit from the same high quality of classroom-based learning in locations closer to home.
